        <p className="my-5 text-lg">
          The rising cost of healthcare is a global challenge, impacting
          patients, healthcare providers, insurers, and governments. Factors
          such as advancing medical technologies, administrative inefficiencies,
          pharmaceutical price surges, and an aging population all contribute to
          increasing expenses. As costs rise, affordability becomes a critical
          issue, with many individuals struggling to access necessary medical
          care.

            Increasing Costs of Medical Technology & Innovation
          </li>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-lg mb-5">
            <li>
              Advanced medical devices, robotic surgeries, and AI-driven
              diagnostics enhance healthcare quality but come at a high cost.
            </li>
            <li>
              The rapid adoption of personalized medicine and genomics-based
              treatments increases research and development (R&D) expenses,
              driving up prices.
            </li>
            <li>
              High costs of specialized equipment and facilities (e.g., proton
              therapy centers for cancer treatment) contribute to overall
              expenditure.
            </li>

          <li className="text-lg font-bold">
            Pharmaceutical & Prescription Drug Costs
          </li>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-lg mb-5">
            <li>
              High R&D costs: On average, it costs over $2.6 billion to bring a
              new drug to market.
            </li>
            <li>
              Patent protection laws prevent generic alternatives from entering
              the market quickly, keeping drug prices high.
            </li>
            <li>
              Price gouging & monopolies: Some pharmaceutical companies increase
              drug prices exponentially, even for essential medications.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <li className="text-lg font-bold">
            Administrative & Operational Inefficiencies
          </li>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-lg mb-5">
            <li>
              Complex insurance & billing processes lead to excessive
              administrative costs.
            </li>
            <li>
              The U.S. spends over 25% of healthcare expenses on administration,
              compared to 10-15% in other developed nations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Inefficiencies in Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems, claim
              processing, and provider reimbursements add financial burdens.
            </li>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-lg mb-5">
            <li>
              Longer life expectancy leads to increased demand for long-term
              care, geriatric services, and chronic disease management.
            </li>
            <li>
              Chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity
              drive long-term medical expenses.
            </li>
            <li>
              The cost of treating chronic diseases accounts for more than 75%
              of total healthcare expenditures in many developed nations.

            Hospital Consolidation & Reduced Competition
          </li>
          <ul className="list-decimal pl-5 text-lg mb-5">
            <li>
              Mergers between hospitals create regional monopolies, reducing
              price competition.
            </li>
            <li>
              Hospitals charge significantly more for procedures in areas with
              fewer competitors.
            </li>
            <li>
              Private equity firms buying hospitals often prioritize profit over
              patient affordability.

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 text-lg mb-5">
            <li>
              Fear of lawsuits causes doctors to order unnecessary tests,
              procedures, and imaging (defensive medicine), driving up costs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Malpractice insurance premiums further increase the financial
              burden on providers and patients.
